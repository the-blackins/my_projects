based on version which was previously written 
i have decided to udate my code due to the excess else if statement used in my program which might affect the quick response from multiple users trying to pull request 
iso im trying to amend my algorithm in a way that complies with scalability 
my first approach towards this version update

$ to reduce the if else statement used 
$ then look for an alterntive method for the implemmentation of this program

i was able to update my code to a more simpler version with less code required to perorm the same function. hence, reduces the risk of experiencing  the worst case condition or scenerio of my algorithm. Furthermore i was able to utilize the some of the major properties of the pyton language which are the inheritamce, usimg of classes and objects, model utlization etc 

# part 2 :program update
i have decided to upskill my game and improve my reasoning skills by implementing multiple currency in my program 
# approach
 pulling the currencies from the json file 
 storing the keys and value in seperate empty list of array 
 append the keys from rates dictionary to array 1 
 append the values from rates dictionary to array 2 
 and lastly printing the available currency  in the command line interface or the terminal 

 # part 3: program update 
 i have been n a ble to achieve the previously enlisted goals or objective , 
 my next objective is to append an index to every rate enlisted.
# approach 
ill be using a for loop to assign an index to every currency enlited
